COMPILATION INSTRUCTIONS

Use make all to produce both tools. Use make <toolname> to produce each of
them separately.

USAGE INSTRUCTIONS

There are two tools: runcop and filecop. They are mainly intended to test and
try the algorithms. You may run over large data files with the existing tools,
but the output is not nicely factorized, so it may take a long time.
Please feel welcome to add your own code using the algorithms coded in the
source files (check filecop.c and runcop.c to see how to be used) or contact us
(contact information in the associated publications or in
http://kapow.dc.uba.ar).

Both tools work similarly. runcop uses strings passed as parameters as input
for the algorithm (better to try small cases and see how it works) and filecop
uses files. Both tools take a list of strings/files as parameters, and run the
algorithms over those inputs. If -c is passed (before or after the input list)
it will report supermaximal repeats in the set. Otherwise it will report
exclusive repeats. By default it reports supermaximal exclusive repeats, and
it reports maximal exclusive repeats if -nm is passed as parameter. The
parameter -ml followed by an integer may optionally be passed, to state the
smallest size of a repeat should have to be reported (it is 1 by default).
filecop has additional useful options (more verbose error output and time
calculations). For additional help on tool usage, run it without any
parameters.

The output only lists the repeats, one per line (avoid using files with end of
line markers in them, because the output will be confusing). It does not give
information on the occurrences of the string, although the coded algorithms do
report that information. You can easily modify the tool so it gives some more
information if you need it, or create your own tool. Once again,
feel free to contact us for help using the algorithms for experiments that need
non-trivial adjustments.
